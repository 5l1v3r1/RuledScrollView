RuledScrollView
===============

Android ScrollView implementation with additional touch-interception-rules.

##Question##
Have you ever tried to use a **ScrollView** and another **ScrollContainer** in one layout tree?

Not yet? Lucky you!

For everyone else read carefully.

##Analysis##
Android updated there **ScrollView** *onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent event)* implementation to ignore touch events when **ScrollView** is at top and can't scroll any further. There for with **API 14** (Android 4.0) comes **View**.*canScrollVertically(int direction)* and **View**.*canScrollHoricontally(int direction)*.

> if you need lower API, you can use **ViewCompat** instead

But why only one direction and one axis?

##Solution##
Create a custom **ScrollView** with an full implemented *onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent event)* method. Enable some configuration with custom rules.

**Rule** let you manage all children views without extend any other classes.


##Benefits##

Change scroll behaviour of nested scrollable views in real time via code.

##Problems##
You will get some performance problems if you have done a really fancy view tree with a lot of **ViewGroups** and scrollable **Views**.
